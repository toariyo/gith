            <h4> I Am Chef</h4>
              <p3>“I Am Chef” is an android app that would take in any of your health conditions, ingredients you have, and or goals you 
                  have to then give you recipes that will help you reach your goals or just stay healthy in general. Me and a group of my 
                  peers are creating “I Am Chef” for our Senior Capstone Project, although the app idea is not ours.
                  My primary role in the creation of “I Am Chef” is too create the categories page that will show the different categories of 
                  food/ingredients and to create the search feature. I will also be the one of the people making the algorithm that will 
                  show users the recipe(s) that they would be more likely to enjoy based on their past choices.</p3>
                <p4>Code can be sent upon request, once the app is launched the google play link will be here.</p4>
