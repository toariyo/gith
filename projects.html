      <h2 class="hover" onclick="location.href = 'https://github.com/toariyo/Gamers4Life'">Gamers4Life</h2>
        <p3>This is a user-interactive gaming website, utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, that allows users to play several games such as Reverse Hangman, Jeopardy, GifHaven, and Fast Food Restaurant Quiz. This gaming website was created during an apprenticeship at the Google Computer Science Summer Institute. More games coming soon!!</p3>
      <h2 class="hover" onclick="location.href = 'https://github.com/toariyo/DeepCubeA_Exercises_toariyo'">DeepCubeA Exercises</h2> 
         <p3>This project contains solved exercises from DeepCubeA, a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm that can learn to solve the Rubik Cube. DeepCubeA solves 100% of all test configurations, finding a shortest path to the goal state 60.3% of the time. DeepCubeA generalizes to other combinatorial puzzles and is able to solve the 15 puzzle, 24 puzzle, 35 puzzle, 48 puzzle, Lights Out and Sokoban, finding a shortest path in the majority of verifiable cases. These exercises utilize Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically Planning Domain Definition Language, and neural networks. These exercises were solved over the course of a research internship with the Artificial Intelligence Institute at University of South Carolina.</p3>
         <h2 class="hover" onclick="location.href = 'https://github.com/toariyo/tumord'">TumorD</h2>
         <p3>This is a simple computational method, utilizing Pandas, SciKit-Learn, and several Python data science libraries to perform Principal Component Analysis and a machine learning algorithm, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors, for tumor cell detection in ultra-low single-cell DNA sequencing data and further analysis that was created during a summer research internship with the National Institutes of Health and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The following project was completed on a jupyter notebook. The "KNN" folder contains Patient S0 and Patient S1 single-cell sequencing data analysis utilizing the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm and other data science libraries. The PCAanalysis folder contains intensive analysis of Patient S0 and Patient S1, including doublets, sections, and tumor cells, utilizing Principal Component Analysis and other data science libraries. Patient S0 and Patient S1 were optimized for an accuracy of approximately 98% for tumor cell detection. Patient single-cell DNA sequencing data was provided by Simone Zacarria from CHISEL. Additional help and assistance was provided by mentors Mohammed El-Kebir and Leah Weber.</p3>
         <h2 class="hover" onclick="location.href = 'https://github.com/toariyo/Password_Verification'">Password Verification</h2>
         <p3>This is a quick and simple Python method that utilizes lambda functions and several boolean logical statements to validate a given password. The password must contain atleast one uppercase letter, atleast one lowercase letter, atleast one digit, and atleast 8 characters. This method was created for tutoring fellow students in lambda functions and its applications.</p3>
