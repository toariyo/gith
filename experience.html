      <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Google - Computer Science Summer Institute</h2>
      <h2><i>Software Engineer Apprentice</i></h2>
        <p3>Completed a project-based JavaScript and Firebase curriculum taught by Google software engineers and configured 12 individual software projects (JavaScript, HTML, CSS). Attended product design, resume development, and software engineering workshops and delivered a collaborative final product presentation to Google software engineers and product managers.</p3>
      <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Artificial Intelligence Institute at University of South Carolina</h2>
      <h2><i>Research Intern</i></h2>
         <p3>Developed Deep Reinforcement Learning model (Planning Domain Definition Language) for several applications (Python). Applied Planning Domain Definition Language to assist in maximizing the probability of goal achievement, optimizing probability to 99% of all test configurations, finding a shortest path to the goal state 60.3% of the time and generalizing the model to other combinatorial puzzles (Python).
</p3>
         <h2 style = "text-align: center;">National Institutes of Health - National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</h2>
      <h2><i>Research Intern</i></h2>
      <p3>Constructed a computational method using data science libraries to mathematically model ultra-low coverage single-cell DNA sequencing data of tumor cells (Python). Implemented machine learning approach to accurately detect tumor cells in ultra-low coverage single-cell DNA sequencing data, optimizing algorithm for approximately 98% detection across Patient S0 and Patient S1 (Python).</p3>
         <h2 style = "text-align: center;">South Carolina STEM Academy</h2>
      <h2><i>Teaching Assistant</i></h2>
         <p3>Mentored disadvantaged middle school students in learning programming languages (Python, Java). Assisted in further efforts of teaching lessons on operating Arduino boards and Raspberry Pi. Designed and facilitated STEM challenges and team building activities. Managed positive social media branding.</p3>
